## Little About Me
I graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2023 (We Are!!) where I was deeply involved in the automation simulation (self-driving) industry. After graduation, I decided to pursue my Master's degree at Northwestern University(go cat!). There, I shifted my focus to Machine Learning, LLMs, and NLP because of my fascination with "being a brain, being an algorithm itself." Throughout my academic journey and experience in robot competitions, my goal is to be an engineer who designs decision-making processes (feedback -> response).


In my past journey, I have acquired a diverse array of tools and techniques through internships and work, some closely tied to Computer Science, while others venture beyond it. Iâ€™ve always cherished the learning process itself over the immediate application, believing that the true value lies in cultivating the ability to grasp new tools and wield them effectively. I see myself as a sponge, absorbing every skill and experience, all in preparation for the day I can create something truly remarkable for society.

Just like Steve Jobs, who took a calligraphy class out of interest, only to later use that knowledge to make the first Macintosh the first computer to allow users to change fonts.
