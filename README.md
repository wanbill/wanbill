## Little About Me
I graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2023 (We Are!!) where I was deeply involved in the automation simulation (self-driving) industry. After graduation, I decided to pursue my Master's degree at Northwestern University(go cat!). There, I shifted my focus to Machine Learning, LLMs, and NLP because of my fascination with "being a brain, being an algorithm itself." Throughout my academic journey and experience in robot competitions, my goal is to be an engineer who designs decision-making processes (feedback -> response).


In my past journey, I have acquired a diverse array of tools and techniques through internships and work, some closely tied to Computer Science, while others venture beyond it. Iâ€™ve always cherished the learning process itself over the immediate application, believing that the true value lies in cultivating the ability to grasp new tools and wield them effectively. I see myself as a sponge, absorbing every skill and experience, all in preparation for the day I can create something truly remarkable for society.

Just like Steve Jobs, who took a calligraphy class out of interest, only to later use that knowledge to make the first Macintosh the first computer to allow users to change fonts.I believe it's up to me to combine all my past experiences and transform them into something meaningful, unlocking the potential for breakthrough innovation.

## Something that is not in my Resume!

My first internship is a startup company in New Taipei City, Taiwan. At there, I not only learn how to code but also have the chance to do an elevator pitch to Foxconn in the job match event for crowd funding. I learn how to communicate and sale our product efficently. 

There are many motivations to pursue Computer Science, but mine is different. During high school, I had the opportunity to participate in a robotics competitionâ€”Rescue Line (RoboCup). The spark was ignited when I was amazed by the multi-sensor capabilities of a humanoid robot and the logic and algorithms it used to process data and imitate human sports. I ended up placing eighth at the 2016 World League in Leipzig, competing against 43 teams, and fifth at the 2017 World League in Nagoya, out of 56 teams. That experience planted the idea in me: to become the brain, to be the algorithm itself. (Representative team of Taiwan 2016, 2017)

## Ongoing Research Projects

Currently, I am working on financial analyst with large language model with dataset from WRDS UPenn.
